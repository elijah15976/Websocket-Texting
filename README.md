# Websocket Texting Thingy :)

This is some side project that I made for fun ehehe

Make sure you have `ws` installed using:
```
npm install ws
```

To start the application, double click on `start.bat`

---

There is a known vulnerability, so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT use this in production site

Chat is allowed full html code, so cross-site scripting is possible

If you don't trust me, send the following message:
```
<img src="" onerror="setInterval(() => {alert('hi');}, 500);" />
```
